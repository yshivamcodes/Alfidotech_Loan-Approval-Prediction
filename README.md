# Alfidotech_Loan-Approval-Prediction

This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether a loan application will be approved or not, based on applicant data. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training using **logistic regression**.

## 📂 Files

- `Loan Approval Prediction alfidotech.ipynb`: Complete notebook with EDA, model building, and evaluation.
- `loan_prediction.csv`: Dataset containing loan applicant data and approval status.

## 🔍 Key Steps Performed

- Handling missing data and encoding categorical features.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify important trends.
- Visualization of loan approval patterns by income, education, and credit history.
- Feature scaling and train-test splitting.
- Model building using Logistic Regression.
- Evaluation using accuracy and classification metrics.

## 📊 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📌 Highlights

- Strong correlation found between credit history and loan approval.
- Income and education levels play a role in loan approval rates.
- Logistic regression gives a good baseline accuracy for this classification task.
